# Insurance Prediction with Multiple Linear Regression (Python + PyQt5)
## Overview
This project is a Python-based application that utilizes the multiple linear regression algorithm to predict insurance charges. The application includes a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented with PyQt5 for an interactive user experience.

## Features
Multiple Linear Regression Model: Utilizes machine learning to predict insurance costs based on multiple independent variables such as age, BMI, number of children, etc.

PyQt5 GUI: The application boasts an intuitive and interactive GUI built with PyQt5, enabling users to input data and obtain insurance predictions seamlessly.

Data Preprocessing: Incorporates data preprocessing steps to handle missing values, scale features, and ensure the model's accuracy.

Model Evaluation: Provides evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the multiple linear regression model.

## Technologies Used
Python

scikit-learn (for machine learning)

PyQt5 (for GUI)
